                <p>We are David, Leo, and Payson and we made a lot of maps.</p>
                <p>For this project, we used:</p>
                <p>API and CSV to generate data, Python and Pandas to clean data, and SQL to store data and exacute queries.</p>
                <p>We also used Flask and Jinja, Leaflet and it's plugins, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for styling...</p>

                <h2>Starting with a Cluster Map</h2>
                <p>The first thing we did was make a cluster map. It was a nice place to begin because we had a solid example from which to jump.</p>
                <p>The scores are color coated on the markers, and we added a search control - a plugin we had not yet used.</p>
                <p>The marker here in the story map is relativley abitrary. It is the Lat and Long of Benu, a fancy SF resturant that I used repeatedly to see if the search function worked.</p>
                <p>The Leaflet plugin did not allow for searching clustered markers, so we had to create a separate layer of invisible markers to search.</p>
                <p>You can check out both the code for the invisible markers and the map itself below.</p>

                <h2>Over the Years...</h2>
                <p>We took the database provided by the SF goverment and set up a map to filter data by the year, incident type, and score.</p>
                <p>The data provided was over the years of 2016-2019</p>
                <p>The pandemic halted inspections for awhile so there is some funky data in there and a few resturants out there that exist and have not been updated in either the database or the API</p>

            <section data-place="jumbo">
                <h2>New Jumbo Seafood and Sunflower Restaurant</h2>
                <p>We did SQL queries to find out which resturants were the worst!</p>
                <p>Over the period of provided data, New Jumbo Seafood (marked on the map) and Sunflower Restaurant had the lowest avg score at 60.5 and 63.5 respectivley. Both are still in operation today.</p>
                <p>We also used Flask to take the API data and convert it into a DataFrame. Using Python and Pandas, we extracted only the restaurants with recent incidents categorized as high-risk.</p>
                <p>First, we rendered the restaurants variable to the template:</p>
                <img src="static/images/render_to_template.png" alt="Render Image">
                <p>Then we called the Jinja variables in HTML while converting it to JSON:</p>
                <img src="static/images/html_jinja.png" alt="HTML_Jinja Image">
                <p>Lastly, we accessed the restaurants variable directly in our script as a normal variable:</p>
                <img src="static/images/js_jinja.png" alt="JS_Jinja Image">
                <p>Check it out running on localhost.</p>

            <section data-place="lees">
                <h2>The Case of Lee's Deli </h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="static/images/lees.png" alt="Lee's Restaurant">
                </div>
                <p>In our first SQL searches, we found that Lee's had the most high risk incidents. However, we did not include the business id and because Lee's had multiple locations, it semmed worst than it was.</p>
                <p>Once we fixed this and used both the business name and busniess id to filter resturants, we found that Lee's had 4 locations, with an avg score of approx 83.9</p>
                <p>We still had an issue when accounting for incident counts once we added business ids.</p>
                <p>For instance, Taqueria Cancun where one of us used to eat a lot cira 2008, had 6 incidents, but it also had the most inspections of any non-school over the period. Once we adjusted for incidents per inspection date, we found that there was only one recorded incident per visit for every foodservice establishment.</p>

            <section  data-place="schools">
                <h2>Schools</h2>
                <p>Look, school is important but it doesn't necessarly have the best repuation for good food.</p>
                <p>It may not be good, but it is safe.</p>
                <p>We found that out of the 379 spots with good inpections (with 2 or more inspections with an avg score over 92), 49 were schools.</p>
                <p>Our queries found that Francisco Middle School with an avg score of 96.4 did the best and is marked on our story map.<p>
                <p>In case you are wondering, Tenderloin Elementry did the worst with an avg score of 89.4.</p>
